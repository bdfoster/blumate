BluMate is an automation hub built using Python 3. It is a fork of `Home Assistant <https://home-assistant.io>`__
that hopes to improve some aspects related to complexity and generality (making this suitable for both home and business
use cases).

It is not my intent to directly compete with `Home Assistant <https://home-assistant.io>`__, it is actually my intent to
contribute as much as possible. However, my use cases are quite different from Home Assistant and some changes would not
be appropriate for them.

As it sits today, much of the code remains unchanged from the original `Home Assistant <https://home-assistant.io>`__
project, however this will change in the coming months.
